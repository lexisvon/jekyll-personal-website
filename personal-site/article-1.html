     <p>Creating a dynamic navigation that is responsive sounds dreadful. In this tutorial I am going to demonstrate a way this can be completed.</p>
     <p>The first step is to create our file system. We need an index.html, script.js, and styles.css. Really thatâ€™s it to get this functioning. Once those files have been created time to get to work in whatever text editor suits you. I prefer sublime text.</p>
